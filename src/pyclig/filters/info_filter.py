        There are two different ways to implement this. First, like we have,
        second is to use:
            >>> return record.levelno in (DEBUG, INFO)

        While this works, it is limited to those values, and does not support
        custom log levels which a user has defined between the official ones.

        We instead have taken the approach of saying the official level goes
        from INFO to WARNING, as such, anything less than a WARNING is still
        INFO level.
